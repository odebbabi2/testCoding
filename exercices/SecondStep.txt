Now that we can have clients, we must propose the products

- Let's start by the product clients like the most : le LivretA. LivretA has an annual rate of 0.75%.
To calculate the cost of this product each month for the bank, the formula is : amount * (rate/100) / 12.

- Let's add LDD. LDD has an annual rate of 1%.
To calculate the cost of this product each month for the bank, the formula is : amount * (rate/100) / 12.

- Let's add CompteAvue. CompteAVue has an annual rate of 0.5%.
To calculate the cost of this product each month for the bank, the formula is : amount * (rate/100) / 12.

- We must be sure that each client has only one instance of each product.
